## Backstory

Agent 42, an ex secret service field agent, has money problems. He owes a couple million
dollars to a crime lord, who doesn’t want to wait for his money any longer. Agent 42 has to use
the skills he acquired while working as a secret agent. Unfortunately, he can’t find a way to use
these and stay law-abiding.
He is thus forced to become a henchman, providing his services to multiple mafias.
