## The Baguettes

We are a team of 4 [EPITA](http://www.epita.fr/) students.
We share an interest in programming and games. We are all looking forward to gaining experience from this project.
We believe that creating a game is a good way to learn to work as a team.

We call ourselves *The Baguettes*, inspired by rock and roll bands with names which have little meaning.
Baguette comes from the fact that our group is made of two Chinese, and two French people. Referencing chopsticks and the French bread.
